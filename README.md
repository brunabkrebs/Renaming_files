# Renaming_files

This is a simple program to rename files. Specifically, this program allows you to substitute a certain string found in filenames by a new string. 

You choose the directory containing the files you want to rename, set your 'old word' and 'new word'. 

The program will rename all files in the chosen directory that contain the 'old word' on the filenames, and substitute it for the 'new word'. 

Only the 'old word' string on the filename will be edited, the remaining characters on the filename will stay the same.
